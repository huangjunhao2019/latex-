	In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is started by 
the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation
\[E=mc^2\]
discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 
In natural units ($c=1$), the formula expresses the identity
\[E=m\]

Subscripts in math mode are written as $a_b$ and superscripts are written as $a^b$. These can be combined an nested to write expressions such as
\[T^{i_1 i_2 \dots i_p}_{j_1 j_2 \dots j_q}=
T(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_p},e_{j_1},\dots,e_{j_q})\]
We write integrals using $\int$ and fractions using $\frac{a}{b}$
. Limits are placed on integrals using superscripts and subscripts:
\[\int_0^1 \frac{1}{e^x}=\frac{e-1}{e}\]
Lower case Greek letters are written as $\omega$ $\delta$ etc. while upper case Greek letters are written as $\Omega$ $\Delta$.
Mathmatical oprators are prefixed with a backsalash as $\sin(\beta)$, $\cos(\alpha)$, $\log(x)$ etc.
